# A tiny web app

## Intro
Built with React (CRA), Node.js w/ TypeScript, and MongoDB.

## Run instructions
```
// open a terminal window
// start server
cd tiny-server/
npm install
npm run

// open another terminal window
// start client
cd tiny-client/
npm install
npm run
```

Server is running as expected if you see logs for connecting to MongoDB and running on port. You can make a GET request to `localhost:8080/api/ping` to verify a response.

Client is running as expected if the app opens and you see "pong" in the console.
